    "We can see how using techniques such as prompt engineering, RAG, reciprocal rank fusion and semantic query routing can yield good results despite using `chat-gpt-3.5`. We saw the system take a natural language query, route it to the proper sub-system, then provide nuanced answers utilising privately held data. Thereby using RAG to provide a low-cost and flexible alternative to fine-tuning an LLM.\n",
